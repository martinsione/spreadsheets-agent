# Privacy Policy

**Last updated: December 20, 2025**

## The Short Version

OpenSheets is open source software. We don't collect, store, or sell your data. Your spreadsheet data stays in your spreadsheet.

## Data Collection

**We don't collect any personal data.** OpenSheets runs entirely in your browser and communicates directly with the AI provider you configure. We have no servers that store your information.

### What stays on your device:

- Your spreadsheet data
- Your API keys
- Your conversation history
- All settings and preferences

### Third-Party Services

When you use OpenSheets, your prompts and spreadsheet context are sent to your configured AI provider (e.g., Anthropic, OpenAI). These communications are subject to that provider's privacy policy, not ours.

## Open Source

OpenSheets is open source software licensed under the MIT License. You can review exactly what the code does at any time:
